Scenario:
Your team manages mission-critical infrastructure where alerts must be processed quickly and accurately. You need to create a script that can parse, filter, and prioritize alert data from multiple monitoring systems.
Task:
Write a script in a language of your choice (Python) preferred that accomplishes the following:
1.	Alert Data Processing
a.	Parse the provided sample alert data file (sample_alerts.json)
b.	Filter alerts based on multiple criteria (severity, service, and time window)
c.	Group related alerts to reduce noise
d.	Calculate incident priority based on a weighted algorithm
2.	Sample Data Structure:
3.	Required Functionality: 
a.	Function to parse the JSON file and validate its structure
b.	Function to filter alerts by: 
i.	Severity level (critical, warning, info)
ii.	Time range (within the last X minutes)
iii.	Affected service
c.	Function to group related alerts (e.g., multiple alerts from same component)
d.	Function to calculate priority score based on: 
i.	Severity (critical=10, warning=5, info=1)
ii.	Deviation from threshold (percentage)
iii.	Number of affected components
